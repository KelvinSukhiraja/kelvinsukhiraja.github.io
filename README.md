A personal portfolio

ðŸ‘‹ Hey
This is a website that I designed and developed by myself.

-I used ReactJs to make it, to be more specific I used the create-react-app
-For the styling I wanted to try TailwindCSS and surprisingly I found it really great to work with, a great increase in productivity since using it
-The smooth scrolling you see when you navigate the website is from using react-scroll
-The parallax effect you see in the skills section is with react-scroll-parallax
-Contact section is by using emailJS, and yes it does actually work.. all the form submitted got sent to my personal email

If you have any questions feel free to contact me!
